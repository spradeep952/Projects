1. I forgot to add the templates directory in settings.py file's templates_dirs and because of that I was getting TemplateDoesNotFound Exception. Because Django didn't know where the file were the template files kept.
Solution - Don't forget to add you templates directory in settings.py file's Templates-> Dirs list.
add os.path.join(BASE_DIRS, '<YourAppName>/templates'), 

2. I was having problem in including the app urls.. like distinguishing the urls for different apps. So here we can make us of the
  from django.urls import include
  path('', include('<appname>.urls'))
  and then you make your own url patterns based on the app
